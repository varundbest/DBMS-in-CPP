All the syntax is checked in functions.h, 
keywords.h contains all the keyword functions like createTable(), createDatabase(), insert() etc. These functions are called if the syntax matches in functions.h

commonf.h contains all the useful common functions which the other functions need, as well as a class named date which holds the info for a date (also contains string to date conversion copy constructors, relational operators, etc)

I've added comments before most functions on what they do and how.

I've also corrected some errors with the date class, now insertion works flawlessly.

I've attached a file named Varun. It is a database file (database name: varun). It contains one table (named "type").
it contains 8 rows, one for the attribute names and types, and 7 tuples which store data. You can insert as many as you like (there is a limit though, but it is really large.. million+)
